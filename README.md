## Description of the project

This project consists of three main pages:

1. **To-do List:** In this page, users can manage their tasks. They can add new tasks, mark completed tasks, and delete tasks. Additionally, the header contains a profile icon that allows users to navigate to the profile page.
2. **Profile Page:** The profile page displays user information. Users can view their profile details, such as profile picture, name, and email. Additionally, the page provides real-time weather conditions for the user’s city.
3. **Error Page:** If a user navigates to a non-existent page, they will be redirected to the error page. The error page informs the user that the requested page was not found. A “Return to Main page” button allows users to go back to the main page.

## Technologies Used
- React.js (functional components and React hooks)
